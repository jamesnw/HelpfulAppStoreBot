==================

Post helpful links to iOS apps on Reddit. Simply include "app link:" or "applink:" followed by a comma separated list of apps to link to. I'll reply as soon as I can.

Examples: 
```
applink: Alien Blue, Bittorrent sync, Facebook
App Link: Instagram
```
Your comment can include other things as well- I'll just pull out the info I need. The link is to the top search result given your phrase- leave a comment if it's wrong.

Currently enabled on [/r/iPhone](http://reddit.com/r/iPhone). More to come, after checking with a subreddit first.

####Affiliate links
Each link comes with an affiliate and a non-affiliate link. If you click the affiliate link, the developer will still get their 70%. I will get 7%, reducing Apple's take to 23%. I will be sharing these numbers periodically in the interest of transparency.
